 Connected Components in Graphs 
 Disconnected Graph : Component1 + Component2 + Component3 make up a single disconnected graph. 
           Graph can be either single component or more than one components. 
 Even a single node can be called as a component. 
           Write code for multiple components whether it is DFS or BFS.
 Take visited array and initialise as 0
           for(int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
                if (!visited [ i ] ) {
                         write code for either BFS or DFS
                }
           }
 How to find the number of components?
          Count the number of time your code goes inside the if statement.
