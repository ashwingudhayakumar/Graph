 Graph Terminology - Vertex, Node, Edge
 Graph Types : Undirected (edges do not have directions) and directed graphs (has direction ->)
 Indegree and out degree of graphs - degree of vertex : incoming or outgoing edges from the vertex , Undirected graph : total degree = 2 x number of edges of the graph , 
 Directed graph : total degree = indegree + outdegree
 Path in graph : Sequence of node(vertex) - You cannot visit the node more than once.
 Undirected Cyclic Graph - has cycle 
 Undirected Acyclic Graph - has no cycle (can be also called tree) 
 Directed Cyclic Graph 
 Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
 Weighted Undirected Graph (edge has weights) 
 Assume weight 1 if edge weight is not given to solve the problem
